## About this repository

You can find here some of the best jupyter notebooks I wrote on different data science topics : **content recommendation**, **computer vision**...


## What is already here

- **NIST-OCR** : **optical handwritten character recognition** using supervised algorithms (neural networks) and unsupervised algorithms (K-means clustering). This was carried out in April 2021 in order to complete [Daniel Stockholm](https://www.ephe.psl.eu/ecole/nos-enseignants-chercheurs/daniel-stockholm)'s machine learning course at the Ã‰cole nationale des Chartes ; it relies on a version of the [NIST Handprinted Forms and Characters Database](https://www.nist.gov/srd/nist-special-database-19) he simplified. 

- **SSRS** : content-based **song recommendation system** using genre similarity and distance calculus to recommend the most similar tracks to a reference song chosen by the user. This was carried out in July 2021 ; it relies on a great [Spotify dataset found on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/yamaerenay/spotify-dataset-19212020-160k-tracks).
